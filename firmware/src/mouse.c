/* Concept
	This is an implementation of mouse movement using keyboard directional keys.
	The design is meant to allow useful control of the mouse cursor on the screen
	while being lightweight.
	
	The control scheme is meant to allow the cursor to be moved with enough speed
	that long movements aren't tedious, while still having enough precision to
	make accurate selections on the screen.  Pressing the Mouse-Up, -Down, -Left,
	or -Right keys causes the cursor to move slowly.  Double or triple tapping
	causes the cursor to move increasingly faster.
	
	Accurate control of the mouse requires unit movements at less than the update
	rate of the USB mouse reports.  Therefore, a 10 report cycle is used to evenly
	distribute requests to get a smooth mouse movement.  The report cycle is
	managed at the USB update rate.
