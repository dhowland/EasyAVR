=======================
Configuration Options
=====================

Virtual Num Pad
    On tenkeyless boards, the number row will act like the equivalent number
    pad keys when Num Lock is active.  This allows the user to enter special
    characters using Alt+num combinations.

Win Lock on Scroll Lock
    When the Scroll Lock is active the Windows key is disabled.  This is
    useful for gaming.

Default Layer
    The layer to use at startup and when no Fn keys are active.  Usually this
    would be set to 0.

Basic Keyboard
    This is a 3-way toggle.  When enabled, this setting will force the keyboard
    to present itself as a normal, boot-compatible USB keyboard with 6KRO (NKRO
    disabled).  To be even more standards-compliant it can be bumped to also
    disable the mouse keys and media keys.  This setting will not take effect
    until the keyboard is unplugged.

Unlink Num Lock
    Activating this setting will cause the keyboard or numpad to ignore the
    system Num Lock and keep track of Num Lock internally.  This prevents the
    keyboard or numpad from affecting other keyboards attached to the system.

Default Dimmer Level
    This sets the default brightness of the LED indicators and backlights.
    Although the SCANCODE_BL_ENABLE key only cycles between five levels
    (1, 4, 8, 12, and 16), this setting may be set anywhere between 1 (dimmest)
    and 16 (brightest).

Default Backlight Enable
    This changes the default configuration of the backlight zones on keyboards
    that support backlighting.  The SCANCODE_BL_ENABLE key is used to cycle
    through the different lighting zones, in order.  The number of this setting
    specifies where in that cycle to initialize the backlights.  This only
    takes effect at power-up.

Debounce Time
    The number of milliseconds that the keyboard will prevent a key to change
    state after the switch actuates or de-actuates.  Users should not change
    this setting unless they are seeing chattering (double key presses).
    In that case, use 10ms.  Default is 6ms.

Max Hold Time for Tap
    The maximum number of milliseconds that a key may be held for the press
    to be detected as a tap.  The smaller this value, the faster a user has to
    be to register a key tap.  Default is 240ms.

Max Delay Time for Double Tap
    The maximum number of milliseconds that may elapse between key taps for
    the two actuations to be detected as a double tap.  The smaller the value,
    the faster a user has to be to register a double or triple-tap sequence.
    Default is 120ms.

Base Mouse Movement
    This unitless value controls the minimum speed of the mouse when the user
    presses a mouse movement key.  It should be small enough to allow for
    fine-point control of the mouse.  Default is 5.

Mouse Movement Multiplier
    This unitless value is added to the base mouse movement value for each
    consecutive tap on the mouse movement key.  If a user triple-taps the key,
    the resulting movement value will be (BASE + (MULT * 2)).  Default is 15.

Min Hold Time for Repeat
    The minimum number of milliseconds that a key must be held for rapid fire
    mode to to kick in.  This has no effect on keys that haven't been assigned
    rapid fire mode.  Default is 800ms.

Repeat Period
    The number of milliseconds between repeated key presses when a key is held
    in rapid fire mode.  The smaller the value, the faster the repeat speed.
    Default is 32ms.

=======================
Configuration Options
=====================

The configuration options are stored in non-volatile memory, which means that
they will be saved even when the keyboard loses power.  In order to change a
configuration option, the config console must be used.

Map a key to SCANCODE_CONFIG.  With the keyboard properly programmed, open a
text editor and place the cursor in a new file, ready to type.  Press the
SCANCODE_CONFIG key.  The keyboard will print out a menu into the text editor.

To enter commands, press a single number and press enter.  The config menu
has functions for changing the configuration options.  Don't forget to quit
the interactive mode before moving on to other things!

The data entry interface is very simple.  Non-printed characters that don't
show up in a text editor and typos that you correct are still seen by the
keyboard as input.  It is necessary to type correctly to have your input
recognized.  The interface usually only needs numbers or ENTER.  Characters
other than 0-9 are interpreted as 0.

=============================
Clearing All Saved Settings
===========================

If you set a configuration option that renders the keyboard unusable, you can
clear non-volatile memory by unplugging the keyboard and holding the ENTER key
(as defined on Layer 0) while plugging it back in.
