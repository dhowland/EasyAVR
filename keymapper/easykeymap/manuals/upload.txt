HOWTO: Easy AVR USB Keyboard Firmware - Uploading the firmware

==========================
Bootloader and Boot Mode
========================

Easy AVR supports a number of ways to build and upload your firmware onto your 
device. Different devices use different bootloaders.

What is a bootloader? Well, on the USB AVR, a bootloader is basically a program 
that you put in a special part of a microcontroller's memory that allows you to 
program the microcontroller without any other external programming hardware.

Different devices also use different bootloaders and thus there are different ways 
of uploading the firmware, each particular to the bootloader. Teensy uses its own
HalfKay bootloader. Most other devices will be using the DFU bootloader. If in 
boot mode and your device shows up as a Mass Storage device, then it is using the 
LUFA Mass Storage bootloader. There are other bootloaders out there.

How to put your keyboard into boot mode?  Either press the key sequence that was
previously programmed for boot, or use a hardware reset.  Teensy controllers
have a button.  Most bpiphany controllers have a magnetic switch.  KMAC uses
the Caps Lock key while plugging it in.  Other PDBs have a jumper. 
Know your hardware.

=========================
Uploading from Easy AVR
=======================

Easy AVR supports uploading directly from within the tool as well. There are 
different ways of uploading the firmware.

Upload to Mass Storage
    Use this option if your hardware shows up as a Mass Storage when connected 
    and in boot mode. Put the device in boot mode, select the drive, wait for the 
    success message and then unplug & plug your device back in to see changes. Done.

Upload to Teensy
    Use this option if you are using a Teensy. Put the device in boot mode, wait 
    for success message. Done.

Upload via DFU/FLIP
    If your device does not show up as a Mass Storage in boot mode and you are not 
    using a Teensy, chances are this method is for you. Put the device in boot 
    mode, wait for success message. Done.

==============================
Uploading from External Tool
============================

Easy AVR can be used in conjunction with an external tool. There are two options 
for exporting the firmware, either as a .hex or .bin.

Build your layout with "File->Build Firmware..." or  "File->Build Binary...".
This will create a .hex or .bin file that can be loaded onto your custom keyboard.

Open your programming tool.  In Windows, this is the Teensy Loader for boards
with a Teensy controller (such as Phantom) or this is Atmel Flip for almost 
everything else.  If you're on Mac or Unix, ask Geekhack for help.  Load the .hex 
file you created above. If your device shows up as a Mass Storage, then replace the 
FLASH.BIN with your newly generated .bin file. It must be named FLASH.BIN.

Put your keyboard into boot mode.

Once the bootloader is running, use your programming tool to connect and then
program flash.  When that completes, use your programming tool to reboot the
keyboard.

This is the sequence in Flip:
  Device->Select
  Settings->Communications->USB, then press "Open"
  File->Load HEX File
  press "Run", let it reprogram
  press "Start Application"
