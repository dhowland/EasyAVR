Layers
------

The system contains ten keymap layers that may be configured by the user. 
There is a default layer which is used when no Fn keys are active.  This is 
layer 0 by default, but that can be changed in the config console.  The most 
used mapping layer should be default.  There are also nine further function 
layers. 'Layer 1' is accessed using the 'Fn 1' special modifier key, 'Layer 
2' by 'Fn 2', and so on.

Holding a Fn key in normal mode accesses the associated layer, and using one 
of the lock modes on that Fn key keeps the associated layer active from that 
point forward until another Fn key is pressed. If a new layer is locked while 
another layer is already locked, then the most recent lock takes precedence 
(only one layer can ever be locked at a time).

A Fn key may be accessed from within another Fn layer (chaining).  The 
firmware keeps track of which Fn keys are active and the order they were 
activated.

Key Modes
---------

Any individual key on any layer may be assigned a special operating mode.  
These modes change the key press behavior to something different than the 
normal momentary switch behavior.  The possible settings are described in the 
table, below.  These special modes only work on standard keys (HID 
scancodes), modifiers, and Fn keys.

A key 'tap' is a rapid press and release of a key by itself.  A 'double tap' 
is two taps in quick succession. Think of mouse clicks.

Normal
    Momentary switch.  Press to activate the key and un-press to deactivate.

Toggle
    Toggle switch.  Press to change the state of the key.  If the key is
    deactivated, pressing will activate it and vice-versa.

Sticky
    A single-use modifier toggle.  This is a common accessibility mode known
    as "sticky keys" in Windows.  It makes it possible to build modified
    keystrokes with individual button presses.  Pressing a modifier toggles
    it on.  Pressing any alphanumeric key (or the same modifier again) toggles
    it back off.  This is only available on modifiers and Fn keys.

Tap Key
    Also known as a 'dual use' key.  When a key is assigned to this mode, it
    acts the same as normal but, if tapped, will send a normal scancode of 
    your choosing.  This is only available on modifiers and Fn keys.

Lockable
    Acts the same as normal but double tapping the key will toggle it active.
    Pressing the key again will deactivate it.

Rapid Fire
    This is an auto-repeating mode.  The key acts the same as normal except it
    will be rapidly retyped when the key is held.  Think of old video game
    controllers.  This is only available on standard keys.

When a scancode is bound to a tap key, it will be sent on the upstroke, but
only if the mod/fn key was tapped and not combined with another key. This is
useful in several situations.  For example, the Application key may be used as
a function key but also retain it's use as a normal key.  In another example,
the function keys may be used to simulate Matias half-keyboard by making the
space bar a Fn key with Space as its tap action.

Automatic Modifiers
-------------------

Any key may be assigned an additional modifier state of any combination of 
Shift, Ctrl, Alt, and GUI (meta).  As long as the key is pressed, it will 
also hold the assigned modifiers.  This means you can create a "login" key by 
binding it to Del with Ctrl+Alt.  Or, you could create a "#" key by binding 
it to Shift+3.  This feature only makes sense when the key is in Normal mode. 
Remember that the auto mods can interfere with the actual modifier keys if 
they are held at the same time.

RAM Macros
----------

The system supports one RAM-based macro that can be recorded on the fly.  
Simply press the 'Macro Rec' key, which will set the "Recording" LED Mode to 
indicate that the keyboard is listening.  Type the pattern to be recorded and 
then press the 'Macro Rec' key again.  To play it back, press the 'Macro 
Play' key.  The macro will be lost when the keyboard loses power.  Only 
normal scancodes are supported in the RAM macro at this time.
